letter <i>c</i>) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.\n</p><p>A successor to the programming language <i>B</i>, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n</p><p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\n</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"netdata/netdata",url:"https://github.com/netdata/netdata",description:"Real-time performance monitoring, done right! https://www.netdata.cloud",homepage_url:"",avatar_url:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/43390781?s=80&v=4",num_forks:4425,num_issues:95,num_pull_requests:64,num_stars:47895,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:93,color:"f3f931"},{name:"good first issue",count:4,color:"592fa8"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","C","C++","Objective-C","HTML","JavaScript","CSS","Makefile","M4","CMake"]},{name_with_owner:"openssl/openssl",url:"https://github.com/openssl/openssl",description:"TLS/SSL and crypto library",homepage_url:"https://www.openssl.org",avatar_url:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3279138?s=80&v=4",num_forks:6040,num_issues:117,num_pull_requests:242,num_stars:13576,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:97,color:"008672"},{name:"good first issue",count:15,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Perl","C++","C","Assembly","eC","DIGITAL Command Language","Objective-C","M4","Python"]},{name_with_owner:"radareorg/radare2",url:"https://github.com/radareorg/radare2",description:"UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset",homepage_url:"https://www.radare.org/",avatar_url:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2842539?s=80&v=4",num_forks:2256,num_issues:129,num_pull_requests:35,num_stars:12936,labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:100,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","C","Assembly","Shell","Perl","HTML","JavaScript","C++","Objective-C","CSS"]},{name_with_owner:"taosdata/TDengine",url:"https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine",description:"An open-source big data platform designed and optimized for the Internet of Things (IoT).",homepage_url:"https://www.taosdata.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/48876650?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3252,num_issues:119,num_pull_requests:5,num_stars:12553,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:98,color:"008672"},{name:"good first issue",count:2,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["CMake","Shell","C","C++","Go","CSS","HTML","Java","Python","Yacc"]},{name_with_owner:"memcached/memcached",url:"https://github.com/memcached/memcached",description:"memcached development tree",homepage_url:"https://memcached.org",avatar_url:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/41836?s=80&v=4",num_forks:2824,num_issues:15,num_pull_requests:18,num_stars:10279,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:15,color:"0e8a16"}],issues:[],languages:["Python","C","Shell","Perl","DTrace","Makefile","M4","C++","Roff","Objective-C"]},{name_with_owner:"hashcat/hashcat",url:"https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat",description:"World's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility",homepage_url:"https://hashcat.net/hashcat/",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15949799?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1446,num_issues:46,num_pull_requests:6,num_stars:8367,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:46,color:"159818"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","C","Batchfile","Shell","C++","Perl"]},{name_with_owner:"qmk/qmk_firmware",url:"https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware",description:"Open-source keyboard firmware for Atmel AVR and Arm USB families",homepage_url:"https://qmk.fm",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25358678?s=80&v=4",num_forks:14456,num_issues:229,num_pull_requests:275,num_stars:7257,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"1d76db"},{name:"good first issue",count:23,color:"138217"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","C","C++","Assembly","Objective-C","Ruby","Shell","Python","JavaScript","Nix"]},{name_with_owner:"SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN",url:"https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN",description:"Cross-platform multi-protocol VPN software.

It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications, however many large financial institutions were still developing new systems in COBOL in 2006 due to the mainframe processing speed.</p><p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming language FLOW-MATIC designed by Grace Hopper. It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally seen as a stopgap, but the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is <i>ISO/IEC 1989:2014</i>.</p><p>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like <code class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-c" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span></code>, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, <code class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-cobolfree" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>MOVE</span> <span>x</span> <span>TO</span> <span>y</span></code>).\nCOBOL code is split into four <i>divisions</i> (identification, environment, data, and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n</p><p>Academic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for structured programming. These weaknesses result in monolithic and, though intended to be English-like, not easily comprehensible and verbose programs.\n</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/COBOL_Report_Apr60.djvu",repositories:[]},{name:"cpp",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n\n<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>C++</b> (<span></span>) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</p><p>C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p><p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:2017</i> (informally known as C++17). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:1998</i>, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ is on a three-year release schedule, with C++20 the next planned standard (and then C++23).</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"bitcoin/bitcoin",url:"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin",description:"Bitcoin

encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003.

programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers <i>write once, run anywhere</i> (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p><p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems\' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).\n</p><p>The latest versions are Java\xa014, released in March 2020, and Java\xa011, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java\xa08\xa0LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java\xa08 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12 and 13 are no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 14) or an LTS release.\n</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"elastic/elasticsearch",url:"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch",description:"Open

<b>JS</b>, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.\n</p><p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.\n</p><p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.\n</p><p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.\n</p><p>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.\n</p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp",url:"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp",description:"freeCodeCamp.org's open source codebase and curriculum.

Julia supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and distributed computing (with or without using MPI and/or the built-in corresponding to "OpenMP-style" threads), and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code.

Many libraries are available, including some (e.g., for fast Fourier transforms) that were previously bundled with Julia and are now separate.</p><p>Several development tools support coding in Julia, such as integrated development environments (e.g. Juno, and Microsoft\'s Visual Studio Code, with extensions adding Julia support, both providing debugging support); with integrated tools, e.g. a linter, profiler (and flame graph support available for the built-in one), debugger, and the Rebugger.jl package "supports repeated-execution debugging" and more.</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Julia_Programming_Language_Logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"JuliaLang/julia",url:"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia",description:"The Julia Language: A fresh approach to technical computing.",homepage_url:"https://julialang.org/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/743164?s=80&v=4",num_forks:4050,num_issues:194,num_pull_requests:815,num_stars:28666,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:81,color:"0b02e1"},{name:"good first issue",count:35,color:"0052cc"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Makefile","Julia","C++","Scheme","C","Clojure","Objective-C","Assembly","GDB"]},{name_with_owner:"FluxML/Flux.jl",url:"https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl",description:"Relax!

OCaml was initially developed in the context of automated theorem proving, and has an outsize presence in static analysis and formal methods software. But it has found serious use beyond these areas, with major applications in systems programming, web development, and financial engineering, among other application domains.\n</p><p>The acronym <i>CAML</i> originally stood for <i>Categorical Abstract Machine Language</i>, but OCaml omits this abstract machine. OCaml is a free and open-source software project managed and principally maintained by the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA). In the early 2000s, elements from OCaml were adopted by many languages, notably F# and Scala.\n</p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"facebook/flow",url:"https://github.com/facebook/flow",description:"Adds static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality.",homepage_url:"https://flow.org/",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69631?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1769,num_issues:22,num_pull_requests:134,num_stars:20848,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:17,color:"159818"},{name:"good first issue",count:5,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","JavaScript","OCaml","Standard ML","C","Makefile","HTML","CSS","Ruby","Liquid"]},{name_with_owner:"facebook/infer",url:"https://github.com/facebook/infer",description:"A static analyzer for Java, C, C++, and Objective-C",homepage_url:"http://fbinfer.com/",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69631?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1527,num_issues:13,num_pull_requests:5,num_stars:11138,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:13,color:"159818"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Java","Objective-C","C","Makefile","Python","Perl","C++","OCaml","CMake"]},{name_with_owner:"coq/coq",url:"https://github.com/coq/coq",description:"Coq is a formal proof management system.

"Perl" refers to Perl 5, but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned "sister language", Perl 6, before the latter\'s name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019.</p><p>Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language". Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Raku, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.\n</p><p>The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to <i>Learning Perl</i> (Schwartz &amp; Christiansen) and so on. They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools, facilitating manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p><p>In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was also referred to as the "duct tape that holds the Internet together," in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.</p><p>Perl has been rated as the most expressive programming language.</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Programming-republic-of-perl.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"mojolicious/mojo",url:"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo",description:":sparkles: Mojolicious - Perl real-time web framework",homepage_url:"https://mojolicious.org",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2388868?s=80&v=4",num_forks:513,num_issues:12,num_pull_requests:6,num_stars:2210,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:12,color:"d4c5f9"},{name:"good first issue",count:6,color:"77ff75"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","XProc","Mathematica"]},{name_with_owner:"OpenKore/openkore",url:"https://github.com/OpenKore/openkore",description:"A free/open source client and automation tool for Ragnarok Online",homepage_url:"http://openkore.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/621950?s=80&v=4",num_forks:915,num_issues:13,num_pull_requests:19,num_stars:920,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:13,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","Python","Perl","Shell","C","C++","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Batchfile"]},{name_with_owner:"UPC/ravada",url:"https://github.com/UPC/ravada",description:"Remote Virtual Desktops Manager",homepage_url:"https://ravada.upc.edu/",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3529716?s=80&v=4",num_forks:122,num_issues:29,num_pull_requests:6,num_stars:207,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:21,color:"128A0C"},{name:"good first issue",count:12,color:"5319e7"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","CSS","JavaScript","Makefile","Shell","HTML","Raku","Dockerfile"]}]},{name:"php",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <i>Personal Home Page</i>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <i>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</i>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.  On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code\xa0\u2013  which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data\xa0\u2013  would form the whole or part of a HTTP response.  Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via command-line interface (CLI).\n</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <i>de facto</i> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of July\xa02020, over half of sites on the web that use PHP are still on discontinued PHP versions, and well over a third of all websites use version 5.6 or older, that not even Debian supports (while Debian 9 still supports version 7.0 and 7.1 which are also discontinued by The PHP Development Team). In addition, PHP version 7.2, the most popular supported PHP version, will stop getting security updates on November 30, 2020, then unless PHP websites are upgraded to version 7.3, 70% of PHP websites will be on discontinued versions.\n</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"yiisoft/yii2",url:"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2",description:"Yii 2: The Fast, Secure and Professional PHP Framework",homepage_url:"http://www.yiiframework.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/993323?s=80&v=4",num_forks:6928,num_issues:24,num_pull_requests:56,num_stars:13479,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:23,color:"0e8a16"},{name:"good first issue",count:1,color:"0e8a16"}],issues:[],languages:["PHP","Shell","JavaScript","Ruby","PLSQL","Batchfile","CSS","HTML","Dockerfile","Hack"]},{name_with_owner:"nextcloud/server",url:"https://github.com/nextcloud/server",description:"\u2601\ufe0f Nextcloud server, a safe home for all your data",homepage_url:"https://nextcloud.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19211038?s=80&v=4",num_forks:2108,num_issues:125,num_pull_requests:146,num_stars:11423,labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:73,color:"7057ff"},{name:"help wanted",count:33,color:"006b75"}],issues:[],languages:["PHP","CSS","JavaScript","Shell","HTML","Gherkin","Makefile","Vue"]},{name_with_owner:"octobercms/october",url:"https://github.com/octobercms/october",description:"Free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework.",homepage_url:"https://octobercms.com/",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5554805?s=80&v=4",num_forks:2140,num_issues:22,num_pull_requests:38,num_stars:10078,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:21,color:"5fd350"},{name:"good first issue",count:4,color:"4433e0"}],issues:[],languages:["PHP","JavaScript","CSS","HTML"]},{name_with_owner:"monicahq/monica",url:"https://github.com/monicahq/monica",description:"Personal CRM.

Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p><p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p><p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python\xa02.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.\n</p><p>Python\xa03.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python\xa02 code does not run unmodified on Python\xa03.\n</p><p>The Python\xa02 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release." No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2\'s end-of-life, only  Python\xa03.5.x and later are supported.\n</p><p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.

The language has a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala\'s design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.</p><p>Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, and raw strings. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is checked exceptions, which has proved controversial.</p><p>The name Scala is a portmanteau of <i>scalable</i> and <i>language</i>, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Scala_logo.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"playframework/playframework",url:"https://github.com/playframework/playframework",description:"Play Framework",homepage_url:"http://www.playframework.com/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/319107?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3909,num_issues:73,num_pull_requests:43,num_stars:11649,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:66,color:"7057ff"},{name:"good first issue",count:26,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Roff","TSQL"]},{name_with_owner:"akka/akka",url:"https://github.com/akka/akka",description:"Build highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM",homepage_url:"https://akka.io",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1496237?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3298,num_issues:233,num_pull_requests:42,num_stars:11033,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Scala","Java","Shell","Perl","HTML","JavaScript","Makefile"]},{name_with_owner:"gitbucket/gitbucket",url:"https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket",description:"A Git platform powered by Scala with easy installation, high extensibility & GitHub API compatibility",homepage_url:"https://gitbucket.github.io/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11145783?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1131,num_issues:35,num_pull_requests:28,num_stars:8124,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:35,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","JavaScript","CSS"]},{name_with_owner:"twitter/finagle",url:"https://github.com/twitter/finagle",description:"A fault tolerant, protocol-agnostic RPC system",homepage_url:"http://twitter.github.io/finagle",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/50278?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1364,num_issues:20,num_pull_requests:3,num_stars:7698,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:16,color:"0052cc"},{name:"good first issue",count:5,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Scala","Thrift","Java","Shell","Ruby","HTML","Lua","R","TSQL","Starlark"]},{name_with_owner:"linkerd/linkerd",url:"https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd",description:"A service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond.

is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple\'s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p><p>Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer" way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming" (similar to traits).</p><p>Swift was introduced at Apple\'s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple\'s platforms and Linux.</p><p>Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making source stability a focus in later versions. In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed Objective-C in measured popularity.</p><p>Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures. Code written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built into Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a stable binary interface on Apple platforms, allowing the Swift runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is source compatible with Swift 4.</p><p>Swift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of Swift 5 by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary frameworks that will work with future releases of Swift.</p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"danielgindi/Charts",url:"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts",description:"Beautiful charts for iOS/tvOS/OSX!

It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.\n</p><p>TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.\n</p><p>TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.</p><p>The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, beside C# and other Microsoft languages.
