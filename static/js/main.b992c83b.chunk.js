general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems.\n</p><p>C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity.  It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization.\n</p><p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.

Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a Lisp macro system. The current development process is community-driven, overseen by Rich Hickey as its benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).</p><p>Clojure advocates immutability and immutable data structures and encourages programmers to be explicit about managing identity and its states.

It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications.</p><p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to as "the (grand)mother of COBOL". It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally seen as a stopgap, but the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is <i>ISO/IEC 1989:2014</i>.</p><p>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span></code>, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>MOVE</span> <span>x</span> <span>TO</span> <span>y</span></code>).\nCOBOL code is split into four <i>divisions</i> (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n</p><p>Academic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life, for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for structured programming. These weaknesses result in monolithic and, though intended to be English-like, not easily comprehensible and verbose programs.\n</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/COBOL_Report_Apr60.djvu",repositories:[]},{name:"cpp",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n\n<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>C++</b> (<span></span>) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</p><p>C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p><p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:2017</i> (informally known as C++17). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:1998</i>, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"bitcoin/bitcoin",url:"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin",description:"Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree",homepage_url:"https://bitcoincore.org/en/download",avatar_url:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/528860?s=80&v=4",num_forks:25186,num_issues:47,num_pull_requests:362,num_stars:42295,labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:47,color:"c2e0c6"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","QMake","Python","Makefile","C++","C","HTML","Objective-C++","Java","Objective-C"]},{name_with_owner:"protocolbuffers/protobuf",url:"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf",description:"Protocol Buffers -

Developed to be suitable for teaching, research and industrial application, Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features. Type classes, for example, enable type-safe operator overloading, were first proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott for Standard ML and were first implemented in Haskell. Haskell's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. It is named after logician Haskell Curry.</p><p>Haskell's semantics are historically based on those of the Miranda programming language, which served to focus the efforts of the initial Haskell working group. The last formal specification of the language was made in July 2010, while the development of GHC's implementation has continued to extend Haskell via language extensions. The next formal specification is planned for 2020.</p><p>Haskell is used in academia and industry.

It is intended to let application developers <i>write once, run anywhere</i> (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, \nparticularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p><p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems\' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).\n</p><p>The latest versions are Java\xa013, released in September 2019, and Java\xa011, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java\xa08\xa0LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java\xa08 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Since Java\xa09 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 13) or an LTS release.\n</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"elastic/elasticsearch",url:"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch",description:"Open

It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

"Perl" refers to Perl 5, but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned "sister language", Perl 6, before the latter\'s name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019.</p><p>Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language". Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Raku, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.\n</p><p>The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to <i>Learning Perl</i> (Schwartz &amp; Christiansen) and so on. They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools, facilitating manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p><p>In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was also referred to as the "duct tape that holds the Internet together," in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Programming-republic-of-perl.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"mojolicious/mojo",url:"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo",description:":sparkles: Mojolicious - Perl real-time web framework",homepage_url:"https://mojolicious.org",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2388868?s=80&v=4",num_forks:508,num_issues:14,num_pull_requests:5,num_stars:2184,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:14,color:"d4c5f9"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","XProc","Mathematica","Batchfile"]},{name_with_owner:"OpenKore/openkore",url:"https://github.com/OpenKore/openkore",description:"A free/open source client and automation tool for Ragnarok Online",homepage_url:"http://openkore.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/621950?s=80&v=4",num_forks:843,num_issues:15,num_pull_requests:15,num_stars:842,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:15,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","Python","Perl","Shell","C","C++","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Batchfile"]}]},{name:"php",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>PHP</b> is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <i>Personal Home Page</i>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <i>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</i>.</p><p>PHP code may be executed with a command line interface (CLI), embedded into HTML code, or used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML code or binary image data. PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <i>de facto</i> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of February\xa02020, over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/"EOLed" version 5.6 or older; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2, that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team, while security support is provided by third parties, such as Debian (up to June 2020 for PHP 5).</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"symfony/symfony",url:"https://github.com/symfony/symfony",description:"The Symfony PHP framework",homepage_url:"https://symfony.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/143937?s=80&v=4",num_forks:7455,num_issues:27,num_pull_requests:151,num_stars:22806,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:22,color:"0e8a16"},{name:"good first issue",count:7,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","PHP","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Hack"]},{name_with_owner:"sebastianbergmann/phpunit",url:"https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit",description:"The PHP Unit Testing framework.",homepage_url:"https://phpunit.de/",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25218?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1851,num_issues:13,num_pull_requests:20,num_stars:15870,labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:13,color:"ad7fa8"}],issues:[],languages:["PHP","Smarty","Dockerfile","Shell"]},{name_with_owner:"yiisoft/yii2",url:"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2",description:"Yii 2: The Fast, Secure and Professional PHP Framework",homepage_url:"http://www.yiiframework.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/993323?s=80&v=4",num_forks:6878,num_issues:23,num_pull_requests:55,num_stars:13296,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:22,color:"0e8a16"},{name:"good first issue",count:1,color:"0e8a16"}],issues:[],languages:["PHP","Shell","JavaScript","Ruby","PLSQL","Batchfile","CSS","HTML","Dockerfile","Hack"]},{name_with_owner:"nextcloud/server",url:"https://github.com/nextcloud/server",description:"\u2601\ufe0f Nextcloud server, a safe home for all your data",homepage_url:"https://nextcloud.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19211038?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1778,num_issues:119,num_pull_requests:162,num_stars:9813,labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:75,color:"7057ff"},{name:"help wanted",count:30,color:"006b75"}],issues:[],languages:["PHP","CSS","JavaScript","Shell","HTML","Gherkin","Makefile","Vue"]},{name_with_owner:"octobercms/october",url:"https://github.com/octobercms/october",description:"Free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework.",homepage_url:"https://octobercms.com/",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5554805?s=80&v=4",num_forks:2084,num_issues:16,num_pull_requests:58,num_stars:9549,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:16,color:"5fd350"},{name:"good first issue",count:4,color:"4433e0"}],issues:[],languages:["PHP","JavaScript","CSS","HTML"]},{name_with_owner:"monicahq/monica",url:"https://github.com/monicahq/monica",description:"Personal CRM.

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python\'s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p><p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and  functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p><p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python\xa02.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python\xa03.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python\xa02 code does not run unmodified on Python\xa03.\n</p><p>The Python\xa02 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 (first planned for 2015) after which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it. With Python 2\'s end-of-life, only  Python\xa03.5.x and later are supported.\n</p><p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.\n</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"donnemartin/system-design-primer",url:"https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer",description:"Learn how to design large-scale systems.

Designed to be concise, many of Scala\'s design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.</p><p>Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, and raw strings. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is checked exceptions, which has proved controversial.</p><p>The name Scala is a portmanteau of <i>scalable</i> and <i>language</i>, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/Scala_logo.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"playframework/playframework",url:"https://github.com/playframework/playframework",description:"Play Framework",homepage_url:"http://www.playframework.com/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/319107?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3863,num_issues:73,num_pull_requests:31,num_stars:11526,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:63,color:"7057ff"},{name:"good first issue",count:28,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Roff","TSQL"]},{name_with_owner:"akka/akka",url:"https://github.com/akka/akka",description:"Build highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM",homepage_url:"https://akka.io",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1496237?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3195,num_issues:229,num_pull_requests:45,num_stars:10657,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Scala","Java","Shell","Perl","HTML","JavaScript","Makefile"]},{name_with_owner:"gitbucket/gitbucket",url:"https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket",description:"A Git platform powered by Scala with easy installation, high extensibility & GitHub API compatibility",homepage_url:"https://gitbucket.github.io/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11145783?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1102,num_issues:35,num_pull_requests:27,num_stars:7986,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:35,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","JavaScript","CSS"]},{name_with_owner:"twitter/finagle",url:"https://github.com/twitter/finagle",description:"A fault tolerant, protocol-agnostic RPC system",homepage_url:"http://twitter.github.io/finagle",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/50278?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1330,num_issues:21,num_pull_requests:1,num_stars:7507,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:17,color:"0052cc"},{name:"good first issue",count:5,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Scala","Thrift","Java","Shell","Ruby","HTML","Lua","R","TSQL","Starlark"]},{name_with_owner:"linkerd/linkerd",url:"https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd",description:"A service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond.

class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>Swift</b> is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, and z/OS. Swift is designed to work with Apple\'s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p><p>Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer" way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming" (similar to traits).</p><p>Swift was introduced at Apple\'s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple\'s platforms and Linux.</p><p>Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making source stability a focus in later versions. In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed Objective-C in measured popularity.</p><p>Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures. Code written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built into Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a stable binary interface on Apple platforms, allowing the Swift runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is source compatible with Swift 4.</p><p>Swift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of Swift 5 by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary frameworks that will work with future releases of Swift. </p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"danielgindi/Charts",url:"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts",description:"Beautiful charts for iOS/tvOS/OSX!

As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.\n</p><p>TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js.
