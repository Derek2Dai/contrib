general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and it has therefore found lasting use in applications that were previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.\n</p><p>C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie, between 1972 and 1973. It was created to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. Nowadays, it is one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n</p><p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program that is written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code; the language has become available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.\n</p>",image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"netdata/netdata",url:"https://github.com/netdata/netdata",description:"Real-time performance monitoring, done right! https://my-netdata.io/",homepage_url:"",avatar_url:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/43390781?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3198,num_issues:148,num_pull_requests:40,num_stars:36975,topics:[{name:"monitoring",url:"https://github.com/topics/monitoring"},{name:"iot",url:"https://github.com/topics/iot"},{name:"metrics",url:"https://github.com/topics/metrics"},{name:"notifications",url:"https://github.com/topics/notifications"},{name:"docker",url:"https://github.com/topics/docker"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:99,color:"f3f931"},{name:"good first issue",count:3,color:"592fa8"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","C","C++","Objective-C","HTML","JavaScript","CSS","Makefile","M4","CMake"]},{name_with_owner:"emscripten-core/emscripten",url:"https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten",description:"Emscripten: An LLVM-to-Web Compiler",homepage_url:"",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/46011144?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1959,num_issues:99,num_pull_requests:143,num_stars:16768,topics:[],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:99,color:"fef2c0"}],issues:[],languages:["CMake","Python","Shell","Makefile","HTML","JavaScript","C","C++","Objective-C","Assembly"]},{name_with_owner:"radare/radare2",url:"https://github.com/radare/radare2",description:"unix-like reverse engineering framework and commandline tools",homepage_url:"http://www.radare.org/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/917142?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1817,num_issues:141,num_pull_requests:22,num_stars:9909,topics:[{name:"radare2",url:"https://github.com/topics/radare2"},{name:"c",url:"https://github.com/topics/c"},{name:"commandline",url:"https://github.com/topics/commandline"},{name:"unix",url:"https://github.com/topics/unix"},{name:"reverse-engineering",url:"https://github.com/topics/reverse-engineering"}],labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:100,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","C","Assembly","Shell","Perl","HTML","JavaScript","C++","Objective-C","CSS"]},{name_with_owner:"timescale/timescaledb",url:"https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb",description:"An open-source time-series SQL database optimized for fast ingest and complex queries.

It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications.</p><p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to as "the (grand)mother of COBOL". It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally seen as a stopgap, but the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is <i>ISO/IEC 1989:2014</i>.</p><p>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span></code>, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>MOVE</span> <span>x</span> <span>TO</span> <span>y</span></code>).\nCOBOL code is split into four <i>divisions</i> (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n</p><p>Academic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life, for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for structured programming. These weaknesses result in monolithic and, though intended to be English-like, not easily comprehensible and verbose programs.\n</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"",repositories:[]},{name:"cpp",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n\n</p>\n<p><b>C++</b> (<span></span>) is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language, or "C with Classes". It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.\n</p><p>C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p><p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:2017</i> (informally known as C++17). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:1998</i>, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.\n</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"tensorflow/tensorflow",url:"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow",description:"An

It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to "bytecode" that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2016, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p><p>Java was originally developed by a Canadian James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems\' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).\n</p><p>The latest version is Java SE 12, released in March 2019, which is a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version by Oracle. Since Java 9 is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to "immediately transition" to Java 12. Oracle released the last public update for the legacy Java 8 LTS, which is free for commercial use, in January 2019. Java 8 will be supported with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle and others "highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java" because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.</p><p>Oracle extended support for Java 6 ended in December 2018.</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"iluwatar/java-design-patterns",url:"https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns",description:"Design

It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.\n</p><p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.\n</p><p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.\n</p><p>Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.\n</p><p>The terms <i>Vanilla JavaScript</i> and <i>Vanilla JS</i> refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.</p><p>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.</p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp",url:"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp",description:"The https://www.freeCodeCamp.org open source codebase and curriculum.

Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.\n</p><p>The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed; Wall also alludes to Basic and Lisp in the introduction to <i>Learning Perl</i> (Schwartz &amp; Christiansen) and so on.  They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p><p>In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was also referred to as the "duct tape that holds the Internet together," in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Programming-republic-of-perl.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"mojolicious/mojo",url:"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo",description:":sparkles: Mojolicious - Perl real-time web framework",homepage_url:"https://mojolicious.org",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2388868?s=80&v=4",num_forks:487,num_issues:10,num_pull_requests:3,num_stars:2097,topics:[{name:"perl",url:"https://github.com/topics/perl"},{name:"json",url:"https://github.com/topics/json"},{name:"event-loop",url:"https://github.com/topics/event-loop"},{name:"user-agent",url:"https://github.com/topics/user-agent"},{name:"web-server",url:"https://github.com/topics/web-server"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:10,color:"d4c5f9"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","XProc","Mathematica","Batchfile"]},{name_with_owner:"OpenKore/openkore",url:"https://github.com/OpenKore/openkore",description:"A free/open source client and automation tool for Ragnarok Online",homepage_url:"http://openkore.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/621950?s=80&v=4",num_forks:797,num_issues:16,num_pull_requests:22,num_stars:760,topics:[{name:"ragnarok",url:"https://github.com/topics/ragnarok"},{name:"bot",url:"https://github.com/topics/bot"},{name:"perl",url:"https://github.com/topics/perl"},{name:"automation",url:"https://github.com/topics/automation"},{name:"game",url:"https://github.com/topics/game"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:16,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","Python","Perl","Shell","C","C++","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Batchfile"]},{name_with_owner:"GouveaHeitor/nipe",url:"https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe",description:"Nipe is a script to make Tor Network your default gateway.",homepage_url:"https://heitorgouvea.me/nipe",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10741284?s=80&v=4",num_forks:145,num_issues:12,num_pull_requests:0,num_stars:541,topics:[{name:"tor",url:"https://github.com/topics/tor"},{name:"anonymity",url:"https://github.com/topics/anonymity"},{name:"network",url:"https://github.com/topics/network"},{name:"nipe",url:"https://github.com/topics/nipe"},{name:"privacy",url:"https://github.com/topics/privacy"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:12,color:"159818"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl"]}]},{name:"php",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</b> (or simply <b>PHP</b>) is a general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development.

The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.\n</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <i>de facto</i> standard which other implementations aimed to follow.

respelling"><span>SKAH</span>-lah</i>) is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala\'s design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.</p><p>Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, and raw strings. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is checked exceptions, which have proved controversial.</p><p>The name Scala is a portmanteau of <i>scalable</i> and <i>language</i>, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/Scala_logo.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"playframework/playframework",url:"https://github.com/playframework/playframework",description:"Play Framework",homepage_url:"http://www.playframework.com/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/319107?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3728,num_issues:69,num_pull_requests:47,num_stars:11064,topics:[{name:"scala",url:"https://github.com/topics/scala"},{name:"java",url:"https://github.com/topics/java"},{name:"reactive",url:"https://github.com/topics/reactive"},{name:"web-framework",url:"https://github.com/topics/web-framework"},{name:"restful",url:"https://github.com/topics/restful"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:64,color:"7057ff"},{name:"good first issue",count:24,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Roff"]},{name_with_owner:"akka/akka",url:"https://github.com/akka/akka",description:"Build highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM",homepage_url:"https://akka.io",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1496237?s=80&v=4",num_forks:2991,num_issues:212,num_pull_requests:71,num_stars:9696,topics:[{name:"reactive",url:"https://github.com/topics/reactive"},{name:"distributed-systems",url:"https://github.com/topics/distributed-systems"},{name:"concurrency",url:"https://github.com/topics/concurrency"},{name:"high-performance",url:"https://github.com/topics/high-performance"},{name:"akka",url:"https://github.com/topics/akka"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Scala","Java","Shell","Perl","HTML","JavaScript"]},{name_with_owner:"gitbucket/gitbucket",url:"https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket",description:"A Git platform powered by Scala with easy installation, high extensibility & GitHub API compatibility",homepage_url:"https://gitbucket.github.io/",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11145783?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1052,num_issues:30,num_pull_requests:25,num_stars:7621,topics:[{name:"scala",url:"https://github.com/topics/scala"},{name:"gitbucket",url:"https://github.com/topics/gitbucket"},{name:"git",url:"https://github.com/topics/git"},{name:"scalatra",url:"https://github.com/topics/scalatra"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:30,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","JavaScript","CSS"]},{name_with_owner:"twitter/finagle",url:"https://github.com/twitter/finagle",description:"A fault tolerant, protocol-agnostic RPC system",homepage_url:"http://twitter.github.io/finagle",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/50278?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1244,num_issues:14,num_pull_requests:3,num_stars:7016,topics:[{name:"rpc",url:"https://github.com/topics/rpc"},{name:"distributed-systems",url:"https://github.com/topics/distributed-systems"},{name:"finagle",url:"https://github.com/topics/finagle"},{name:"http",url:"https://github.com/topics/http"},{name:"http2",url:"https://github.com/topics/http2"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:10,color:"0052cc"},{name:"good first issue",count:6,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Python","Scala","Thrift","Java","Shell","Ruby","HTML","Lua","R"]},{name_with_owner:"linkerd/linkerd",url:"https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd",description:"A service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond.

class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Swift</b> is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, and z/OS. Swift is designed to work with Apple\'s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p><p>Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer" way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming" (similar to traits).</p><p>Swift was introduced at Apple\'s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple\'s platforms and Linux.</p><p>Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making source stability a focus in later versions. In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed Objective-C in measured popularity.</p><p>Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures. Code written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built into Xcode.\n</p>\n\n\n',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"danielgindi/Charts",url:"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts",description:"Beautiful charts for iOS/tvOS/OSX!

It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. \n</p><p>TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side (Node.js) execution.\n</p><p>There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.</p><p>TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.</p><p>The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\n</p><p>TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, beside C# and other Microsoft languages. An official extension allows Visual Studio 2012 to support TypeScript as well.</p><p>Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.</p>",image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"Microsoft/vscode",url:"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode",description:"Visual Studio Code",homepage_url:"https://code.visualstudio.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?s=80&v=4",num_forks:9704,num_issues:309,num_pull_requests:195,num_stars:72522,topics:[{name:"editor",url:"https://github.com/topics/editor"},{name:"electron",url:"https://github.com/topics/electron"},{name:"visual-studio-code",url:"https://github.com/topics/visual-studio-code"},{name:"typescript",url:"https://github.com/topics/typescript"},{name:"microsoft",url:"https://github.com/topics/microsoft"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:99,color:"fef2c0"},{name:"good first issue",count:6,color:"fef2c0"}],issues:[],languages:["JavaScript","TypeScript","Batchfile","Shell","CSS","HTML","Java","Clojure","CoffeeScript","C"]},{name_with_owner:"Microsoft/TypeScript",url:"https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript",description:"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.",homepage_url:"https://www.typescriptlang.org",avatar_url:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?s=80&v=4",num_forks:6564,num_issues:588,num_pull_requests:142,num_stars:47056,topics:[{name:"typescript",url:"https://github.com/topics/typescript"},{name:"javascript",url:"https://github.com/topics/javascript"},{name:"language",url:"https://github.com/topics/language"},{name:"typechecker",url:"https://github.com/topics/typechecker"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"009800"},{name:"good first issue",count:5,color:"7944ba"}],issues:[],languages:["JavaScript","PowerShell","TypeScript","Shell"]},{name_with_owner:"ant-design/ant-design",url:"https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design",description:"\ud83c\udf08 A UI Design Language",homepage_url:"https://ant.design",avatar_url:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12101536?s=80&v=4",num_forks:15514,num_issues:33,num_pull_requests:33,num_stars:44432,topics:[{name:"css",url:"https://github.com/topics/css"},{name:"react",url:"https://github.com/topics/react"},{name:"ui-kit",url:"https://github.com/topics/ui-kit"},{name:"ui-design",url:"https://github.com/topics/ui-design"},{name:"typescript",url:"https://github.com/topics/typescript"}],labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:32,color:"0e8a16"},{name:"good first issue",count:2,color:"9ef98e"}],issues:[],languages:["CSS","HTML","JavaScript","TypeScript","Shell","HCL"]},{name_with_owner:"ionic-team/ionic",url:"https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic",description:"Build amazing native and progressive web apps with open web technologies.
